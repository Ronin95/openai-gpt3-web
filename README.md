# openai-gpt3-web
This small web based service can answer you any questions you might have from an AI. 

This was a fun exercise for me to see how to implement the OpenAI API into a website.
I learned a lot of interesting topics, such as the detailed instruction of OpenAI, as well as yarn, vite and a little bit of SSE.
